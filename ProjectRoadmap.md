Project Structure

## Project Structure

Organize the project into folders for better management and clarity. Here's a good structure:

- /src/components: For all React components (Header, Navigation, Project, Footer).
- /src/pages: For the different sections of the portfolio that might need dedicated pages/components (AboutMe, Portfolio, Contact, Resume).
- /src/assets: For static assets like images, fonts.
- /src/styles: For CSS or styling files.


## Building Components

1. Header Component: This component will display the developer's name and house the Navigation component.

2. Navigation Component: This will be used for navigating between different sections of the portfolio. Use react-router-dom for SPA routing without page reloads.

3. Project Component: Represents a single project in the Portfolio section. It will be used this component multiple times, each instance representing a different project.

4. Footer Component: Contains links to social profiles and any other contact information.


## Implementing Functionality

1. Routing with React Router: Set up BrowserRouter in the src/main.jsx file and define routes for different sections/pages.

2. Default Section - About Me: Use React Router's Redirect to navigate to the About Me section by default.

3. Implementing the Portfolio Section: Display multiple Project components here. Each Project component should have props for the image, title, and links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

4. Contact Form: Implement a form with validation for name, email, and message fields. Display validation messages for required fields and incorrect email format.

5. Resume Section: Include a downloadable link to the resume and list the proficiencies.


## Design Considerations

1. Responsive Design: Use CSS or a CSS framework that supports responsive design to ensure your portfolio looks great on all devices.

2. Color Scheme and Fonts: Choose a color scheme and fonts that reflect the personal brand. Ensure readability and accessibility.

3. Animations and Interactivity: Consider adding subtle animations for navigational elements or as part of the page transitions to enhance the user experience.

4. Testing on Different Devices: Regularly test this portfolio on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment

Once the portfolio is ready, it can be deployed it using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Follow the deployment instructions provided by these platforms.

## Final Steps

- Review All Acceptance Criteria: Go through all the acceptance criteria again to ensure your portfolio meets all the requirements.
- Peer Review: If possible, have someone else review your portfolio for feedback on both functionality and design.
- Iterate: Based on feedback, make any necessary adjustments to your portfolio.
